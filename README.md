# diary
A very basic diary application written in C++ and Qt. It keeps its data in an SQLite database. 
Encrypts the text only to keep it safe from your 9 year old sister.

TODO: I will add a login screen to make it safer. Some people may not want a login screen and some may not want even the basic encryption.
I will add an option to keep the diary unencrypted.
